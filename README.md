## Game rules

The 3x3 sliding puzzle game consists of a 3x3 grid with eight tiles and one empty space.

The objective of the game is to rearrange the tiles in numerical order from left to right and top to bottom, with the empty space in the bottom right corner.

(One bug was found. More in the Bugs section.)

To move a tile, click on it and it will slide into the empty space. Only tiles adjacent to the empty space can be moved.

The game can be solved in a minimum of 18 moves, and there is no time limit.

### Features left to implement

* Add Score system table.
  * For example, scores would be counted like this: Time x Move count = Score.
  * Option for game sounds when clicking on the buttons and tiles.
  * Animation for moving tiles.
  * Advanced levels with more tiles.
